# FLPy
Implementations of some formal language algorithms for fun or whatever use you can put them to.

Right now there are two algorithms implemented:

-cyk.py is a version of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm, which is an algorithm to determine whether
any arbitrary string is a member of the language generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form.
What that means is that if you can express some quality that you'd like to verify your input against, 
and you can express that as a context-free grammar, you can use this algorithm to do that in polynomial time,
since any context-free grammar that isn't in Chomsky normal form can be converted to an equivalent one that is
(that's my number-one to-do for that file)

-levenshtein.js provides a way of generating a deterministic finite automation (DFA) for a word w and a non-negative
integer n that accepts any word with n edits (deletions, substitutions, or insertions) of w. Thus, after computing
the automaton, you can use the classic cross-product algorithm with a DFA accepting some dictionary of "good" words
to find fuzzy matches for misspelled ones. Since DFAs take linear time to evaluate, this can happen quite fast.
