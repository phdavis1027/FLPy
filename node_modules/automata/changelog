06-16-2016 *3.0.4*
------------------
* Session serialize/deserialize has an optional parameter 'from_registry'. It set, the FSM serialization will serialize
FSM's name instead of the automata definition, and deserialization, will get the automata fro the registry instead the
embedded definition.
* Ended session's don't have their stack emptied. It is necessary to get end state's name when `current_state_name`
is called.

06-08-2016 *3.0.3*
------------------
* Finished session don't remove `state` info. Necessary to make `currentStateName` and `currentState` to give information
about the last state before getting session finished.

06-08-2016 *3.0.2*
------------------

* `dispatchMessage` now notifies on `onError` callback if the session is finished. Previously it threw an error, making mandatory to wrap dispatchMessage methods with try/catch.
Error callbacks have been refactored to return an Error instead of string.


04-15/2016 *3.0.1*
------------------

* Changed error callback function to accept an Error instead of a String.

04-15/2016 *3.0.0*
------------------

This version is incompatible with V 2.x.x. Before upgrade, please check the following changes:

* Full typscript rewrite. Now the .d.ts file is created from source, not manually maintained.
* Automata definition format changed. Now States are defined in a string array, and initial state is explicitly set by
defining `initial_state`.
* Session Controller methods have changed signature: `session : Session<Controller>, state : string, msg : Message`. Transition
 parameter has been removed because it is redundant (`msg.msgId` is the transition id).
* `dispatchMessage` vs `postMessage`. Now, multiple sessions can create internal state changes in the correct way. External
 message passing must be done by calling `dispatchMessage`. Controller methods that want to trigger an internal state
 change must call `postMessge`.
* Session and their controllers can be serialized/deserialized.

07-07-2015 *2.0.1*
------------------

* Fixed typescript definitions.

07-07-2015 *2.0.0*
------------------

* Version incompatible with any 1.x.x version. Read readme for details.
* Fully asynchronous execution.
* Added 'consume message' callback.
* Logic object does not belong to the automata defintion anymore.
* Logic object concept is deprecated in favor of session controller.
* Session lifecycle has been modified: create, start, end.

07-02-2015 *1.1.1*
------------------

* Module exports for node.

07-02-2015 *1.1.0*
------------------

Major changes.

* Session.dispatch and Session.processMessage dissapear in favor of Session.consume
* Session.consume accepts a callback function triggered when the FDA ends executing its message queue.
* All examples are working.
* Added methods newGuardException and newSessionListener to the module object.
* Added documentation for all object variables.
* Added doclet annotations.
* Checked readme.md
* Guards must throw a GuardException and not any exception. This exception can be created by calling module.newGuardException.

04-02-2013 *1.0.7*
------------------

* Added GuardException as a mechanism to differentiate coding exceptions from GuardedExceptions.
* Better runtime exception handling and report.
* Added methods guardPreCondition and guardPostCondition to Session lifecycle.

05-15-2010 *1.0.6*
------------------

* Fixed some bugs.
* Session logic object receives the FSM.Session as constructor parameter.
* FSMSession object's processMessage function throws an exception if no suitable transition for the current state is
  found. It will silently fail if dispatch method is called.

05-07-2012 *1.0.5*
------------------

* added convention state enter/exit, transition action/preGuard/postGuard as follows:

  state/fsm enter action:   state.name+"_enter"
  state/fsm exit action:    state.name+"_exit"

  transition action:        transition.event+"_transition"
  transition preGuard:      transition.event+"_preGuard"
  transition postGuard:     transition.event+"_postGuard"

* Top level FSM now have correct name. The one they're registered with.
* Fixed a bug that didn't pass properly the state on FSM enter to callbacks.

04-15-2012 *1.0.4*
------------------

* published module 1.0.4
* added onEnter/onExit on subState.
